# Docker + Jenkins Setup

This repository provides a streamlined setup for running Jenkins in a Docker container. It includes instructions for installing Docker, pulling the official Jenkins image, and configuring Jenkins for first-time use. By leveraging Docker, users can quickly deploy a fully functional Jenkins instance with persistent storage and port mappings for easy accessibility.

Jenkins is a powerful automation server widely used for CI/CD pipelines. This setup ensures a stable environment by using the Long-Term Support (LTS) version of Jenkins with options for different Java versions. Additionally, it covers logging into Docker Hub, running the container with necessary port configurations, and accessing Jenkins via a web browser.

For a detailed step-by-step guide, refer to the full tutorial document included in this repository.
